Solution:

i=1
while i<=10:
    print(i)
    i=i+1

Exercise 2: Calculate sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Solution:
s=0
a1=int(input("please enter a number="))
i=0
while i<=a1:
    s=s+i
    i=i+1

print(s)

#if i want to start from another number for the sum just change i to that number

Exercise 3: Print multiplication table of a given number from user
Solution:
num=int(input("Please input a number="))
num1 =int(input("numeber you want to get the table upto="))

for i in range(1,num1+1):
    print(num, "*", i, "=", num*i)
# this give that table of the input number upto desired value

Exercise 4: Calculate the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given number
Solution:

for i in range(1,num+1):
    print(i,i**3)
